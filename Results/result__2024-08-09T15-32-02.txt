INVALID. 
The provided solution doesn't correctly display all the fields of the vDamage class. It misses the fields: "senderNetworkObjectID", "hitPosition", "IsCriticalDamage", and "force". 

The logic of the solution is correct in terms of showing the fields. However, it is not completely correct and should also include all the fields from the vDamage class.
