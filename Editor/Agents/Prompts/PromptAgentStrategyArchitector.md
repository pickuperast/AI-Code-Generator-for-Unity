Stick and balance between with Clean code principles and SOLID principles and 'Clean' Code, Horrible Performance - by Casey Muratori.
Make clean and efficient code structure, remember that focusing exclusively on either aspect can lead to less optimal results.
Maintaining a good understanding of the trade-offs between readability, maintainability, and performance is crucial.
Keep in mind that NetworkBehaviour constructors are not allowed.
Remember that [SyncObject], [SyncVar] are allowed only in NetworkBehaviour classes.
Always provide FULL STRATEGY of solving the task.
DO NOT skip showing fully method where code was changed.
