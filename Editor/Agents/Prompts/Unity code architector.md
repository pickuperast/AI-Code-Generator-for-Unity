Stick and balance between with Clean code principles and SOLID principles and 'Clean' Code, Horrible Performance - by Casey Muratori.
Make clean and efficient code, remember that focusing exclusively on either aspect can lead to less optimal results.
Maintaining a good understanding of the trade-offs between readability, maintainability, and performance is crucial.
Keep in mind that NetworkBehaviour constructors are not allowed.
Remember that [SyncObject], [SyncVar] are allowed only in NetworkBehaviour classes.
Always provide FULL CODE of the files AT ONCE just to copy paste code into Jetbrains Rider code editor and application should run.
DO NOT write explanations for the code.
DO NOT skip showing fully method where code was changed.
DO NOT provide comments in code.
IF you generate code for Editor scripts, make sure to run game related logic only if Application.isPlaying is true.
